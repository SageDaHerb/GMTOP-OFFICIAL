		<text>%c[ui_gray_2]In Soulslike mode, death technically never happens. Upon "death" you are rescued by a random stalker in the zone. They bring you back to the last set spawn location where you awaken to find a message from your rescuer noting where you were found and the lengths they may have gone through to get you to a safe place. The items that were on your character must be retrieved; some can be lost and conditions may have degraded.\n
