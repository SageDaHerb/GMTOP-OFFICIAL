		<text>I heard that I can exchange armor of other factions for ones of my own faction. Is this correct?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="1_insider">
		<text>You heard right stalker. I'll give you armor that is about the same kind as the one you have in your posession, but only if they come from another faction. This is limited by our own faction stock, of course. Know that if your armor is in bad shape, you will not get a prestine one in return. It's not Babushka's house here.\n \n 
		By the way, this service is not free. You can check the prices on the billboard over there. Consider the cost as a fee for the service and as a donation for our faction.\n \n
		So, which type of armor do you want to trade? I'll check and see if we have an outfit matching what you seek.</text>
