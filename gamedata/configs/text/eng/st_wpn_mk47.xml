		<text>An American-made AR-15-style rifle made to be compatible with 7.62mm AK magazines. It was designed to give the American civilian gun owner a reliable domestic weapon for the 7.62x39 cartridge. The rifle has a high degree of compatibility with AR-15 parts and can typically accept the same attachments. While they are usually only semi-auto, the Mk47 rifles in the Zone have been modified with select-fire capabilities.\n \n
