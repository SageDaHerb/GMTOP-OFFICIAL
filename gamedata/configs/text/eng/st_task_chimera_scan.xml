	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_task_chimera_scan_about">
		<text>You've heard of the mutant commonly known as the Chimera, yes? There is much debate in the scientific community about whether the creature is simply a severely mutated animal that came to develop what seems to be a human head OR the result of a terrible breach of scientific ethics. To shed light on this mystery we need more data.\n
		Our technicians prepared a special device to record the precise electromagnetic waves emitted by brains and, well, I mean no offense, but I doubt you would find the rest of the explanation comprehensible. Anyway, what we need is a volunteer to reach a specific Chimera specimen and record its brain signals. Of course, this must be done while the mutant is still living and this is where the difficulty of the task lies.\n
		You will have to get close to it until the device stabilizes and manages to record the signals. After that, it's not necessary to leave the poor creature alive, but that's up to you.
