		<text>Needing a pistol to replace the Russian-made PM, Ukraine created the Fort-12. A formidable weapon largely considered a success, though it falls short when compared to the reliability of the PM. Fortunately, the Fort-12 more than makes up for it in accuracy, magazine size and ergonomics.\n \n
