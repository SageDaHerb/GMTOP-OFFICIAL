MOD OVERVIEW:
> Spelling Corrections:
GMTOP addresses spelling errors across the game, correcting both common mistakes and more complex typos. This ensures that the game's text is accurate and clear, eliminating distractions caused by misspelled words.

> Grammar and Syntax Improvement: 
The mod goes through (almost) all in-game text and applies necessary grammar fixes. This includes correcting sentence structures, verb tenses, and proper use of punctuation to ensure the writing flows naturally and is grammatically correct.

> Capitalization Adjustments: 
Inconsistent or incorrect capitalization can make the text look unprofessional or just sloppy and inconsistent in places. GMTOP standardizes capitalization across all in-game text, particularly in proper nouns, item names, and titles, bringing a uniformity to the written content.

> Word Flow & Clarity: 
One of the core focuses of GMTOP is to improve the readability and fluidity of the game's text. It reworks awkward or stilted phrases (mostly broken Ukranian-translated English from the Anomaly mod and base games) to make the dialogue and descriptions smoother and more natural, enhancing immersion.
